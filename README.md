# **Healthaware: AI-Powered Healthcare Diagnostics**

## **Overview**

**Healthaware** is an AI-powered healthcare platform designed to streamline medical diagnostics through technologies like image classification, OCR-based report parsing, and AI chatbots. It aims to empower individuals and healthcare institutions by providing fast, accurate, and accessible tools for disease detection and basic medical guidance.

## **Features**

### üß† **Automated Health Diagnostics**

* **Medical Object Detection**: Detects medical artifacts like bacilli in sputum images using AI-based image analysis.
* **Image Classification**: Classifies medical images (X-rays, microscopy, etc.) using transfer learning to identify potential diseases.
* **Report Parsing**: Extracts and analyzes information from blood, urology, and other medical reports using OCR technology.

### üí¨ **AI-Powered Health Chatbot**

* Answers general health queries
* Explains complex medical terms in simpler language
* Helps with basic health decision-making

### üõ†Ô∏è **Seamless Integration**

* Easy to adopt in clinics, labs, or hospitals
* Built with **Flask** (backend) and **Next.js** (frontend)
* Designed to be scalable

## **Key Functionalities**

### ü©∫ **Image Classification**

* Upload medical images (e.g., X-rays, sputum images)
* Detect and classify medical anomalies like pneumonia or tuberculosis

### üìÑ **OCR-Based Report Parsing**

* Upload medical reports (PDFs or images)
* Extracts relevant values and data using OCR

### ü§ñ **AI Chatbot**

* Get health-related answers using natural language
* Interact in plain, simple language

## **How to Use**

1. **Upload Medical Image**

   * Go to the dashboard
   * Upload an image (X-ray, microscopy)
   * View real-time diagnosis

2. **Parse Medical Reports**

   * Upload a scanned report
   * Get structured data and diagnosis hints

3. **Use the Health Chatbot**

   * Enter health queries
   * Receive basic AI-generated responses

## **Challenges & Solutions**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

* Ensuring privacy of medical data
* Maintaining accuracy of AI models
* Integrating into existing healthcare systems

### ‚úÖ Solutions

* No storage of sensitive data
* Used **Explainable AI (XAI)** like LRP for transparency
* Collected feedback from real users to improve reliability

## **Potential Impact**
